<p class="hph">Are Volkswagen’s moves upmarket in complete 
    contradiction to the brand’s populist roots? The now-defunct,
     expensive VW Phaeton sedan is often viewed as a radical move 
     aimed away from the masses. But if the Phaeton had worn a more
      prestigious brand name, it conceivably could have been deemed 
      a value. In fact, the Phaeton forms the basis for the Bentley 
      Continental lineup, which starts at $180,395, a sum that is 
      rarely questioned. If we regard the Phaeton as a Bentley for the 
      masses, then the car makes sense as a Volkswagen.</p>
